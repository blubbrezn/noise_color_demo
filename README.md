# noise_color_demo
script for demonstration of different noise signals, with plots of the time domain function, the power spectral density and a hearing example

## usage
start the script from python3 console<br>
randomized white noise is generated<br>
on the left side a small sample of the time domain signal is plotted, on the right the power spectral density of the signal is plotted<br>
by pressing 'p' and enter, the white noise sample (3 seconds) is played<br>
by pressing 'c' and enter, the next noise color is plotted <br>
... the same with the other noise colors<br>

if you want to do some adjustments, like length of the sample, the whole signal or sample frequency, change it in the script
